I want to promote my free tool here.

Is there anyone who could help me by creating a cover and promoting this tool? Consider it a little contribution for love! I’d be super grateful!

This tool integrates five functions:

mimodel texture merging: Combines multiple textures into a single one, ensuring the model displays correctly.

mimodel UV separation and organization: Organizes scattered UV layouts into neat, orderly ones, making the texture look cleaner!

mimodel renaming red overlapping parts: Removes all the red-highlighted parts that look uncomfortable, making it more pleasant for those with OCD!

bbmodel UV face-to-box conversion: Converts the face-by-face UV of bbmodel into box UVs, enabling further conversion into mimodel using the bb built-in plugin, seamlessly transferring from bb to mi.

Multi-line color value to pixel art image: Converts rows of hexadecimal colors outputted by the gradient color calculator into an image, eliminating the need to manually input each one!

Even though it’s in Chinese, you can download the source code (Modelbench-Tools.py) and use AI translation. It’s super fast!
If anyone is willing to help, please contact me via private message or email. Don’t forget to replace the numbers with digits! ①③②③⑦③⑧⑦⑦⑧@QQ.COM
